## Runtime Instructions 

### Library Dependencies

The program has following libraries as dependecies,
<ul>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Time</li>
</ul>

### Program Structure

The code is in a ipnyb notebook and the codes relevant to problems P1,P3, and P4 are in 3 different cells of the notebook with the appropriate headings. 

### Running the Program

To run the program you can download the Jupyter notebook and open it with Jupyter and run assuming you have the neccessary dependencies available. 

### External Sources

The code can also be found on the Google Colab through the link, <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10stMDeTCmo88T3aBe1Se-3YqaLeu3-hf?usp=sharing">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10stMDeTCmo88T3aBe1Se-3YqaLeu3-hf?usp=sharing</a>. I would recommend using this as this would remove the requirement of ensuring the necessary dependencies are met and all the other runtime setups.

**Note**: When opened on GitHub itself, the Jupyter notebook should show the results of the previous runtime.
